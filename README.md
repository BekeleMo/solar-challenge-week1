Solar Challenge Week 1

This repository contains the setup and analysis for the Solar Challenge Week 1 project, focusing on version control, environment setup, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of solar datasets.

Project Overview

The Solar Challenge Week 1 project aims to set up a collaborative development environment and perform data profiling, cleaning, and EDA on solar datasets from different countries. The project is divided into tasks:





Task 1: Git & Environment Setup - Initialize the repository, set up a Python virtual environment, and configure GitHub Actions for continuous integration.



Task 2: Data Profiling, Cleaning & EDA - Perform end-to-end EDA on the Benin solar dataset, including summary statistics, outlier detection, time series analysis, cleaning impact, correlations, wind analysis, temperature analysis, and visualizations.
